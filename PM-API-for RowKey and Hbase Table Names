How Queries related to Hbase Table names and Row Key Formats in PM handled

What was the Ask?
Non-PM module features (e.g., Trends module) need PM KPI data from PM Hbase tables. Need Hbase Table names and row key format details.

What were the challenges?
Dependent on the PM development team for code/details and to share the Hbase table names and row key format details.
Non-PM Developers to develop redundant code for row-key generation in their respective module code.
Difficult to track impacted modules for Row-key related changes.
PM module has different tables based on node hierarchy - Cell, Band, Sector, Site, …. and time/frequency  hierarchy – quarter, hour, daily, BBH, NBH, and Weekly; vendors-Samsung, Airspan, etc; domain-RAN, WiFi

How was it resolved?
We created a library that has methods with input parameters - Domain, Vendor, Frequency Hierarchy, Node-Hierarchy, Start-Date, End-Date, and Node-List for which you want row-keys.
This library has the logic implemented to return the map consisting of two elements {{‘tableName’,’hbaseTableName’},{‘rowkeylist’,’List-of-Row-Keys’}}
